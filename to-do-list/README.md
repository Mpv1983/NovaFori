• How long did you spend on your solution?
3 Hours

• How do you build and run your solution?
Run the API in visual studio
NPM start for the React App

• What technical and functional assumptions did you make when implementing your solution?
This is a shared todo list, different users would have access to the same list
Authentication not required at this stage
Validation was not included as part of the user stories so this has been kept to the bare minimum required by the API

• Briefly explain your technical design and why do you think is the best approach to this problem.
The API is part of a seperate project to the UI. This allows other clients (e.g. mobile to use the same APIS)
This allows for future expandability  


Note

Not all users stories completed, the Update story only the API was completed I ran out of time to do the UI
